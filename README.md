# SmartCryptoServiceProtocolPro

## Description

A Rust-based cryptographic library offering post-quantum secure key exchange protocols using CRYSTALS-Kyber, integrated with a custom memory-safe allocator to mitigate side-channel attacks.

## Features

- Implements a decentralized key management system using Shamir's Secret Sharing.
- Integrates with hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure private key storage and cryptographic operations.
- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving transactions and data validation.
- Supports multi-party computation (MPC) protocols for secure computation on encrypted data.
- Deploys a verifiable random function (VRF) to ensure fairness and unpredictability in leader election and random number generation.
- Enables atomic swaps across different blockchain networks using hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs).
- Implements a robust rate limiting mechanism to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Integrates with existing enterprise identity management systems (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory) via OAuth 2.0 for access control.
